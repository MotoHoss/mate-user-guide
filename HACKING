mate-user-guide
===============

This module is for end-user documents with general MATE applicability 
only.  It will be shipped as the mate-user-guide package. It is possible
that "Help" and or links to individaul packages/modules/applications will show
up here as well.


Documentation for Doc Writers/Contributors
-----------------------------

For help on editing documentation, see the following pages:
http://wiki.mate-desktop.org/dev-doc

If you want to hack on the documentation, don't forget to Join the MATE
Documentation Project:

Please do not forget to check the status here:

Any file that is edited needs to have the following in the header below the
<revision...> tag, above any similiar entries, preferably separated by a blank
line on both sides. Of course your own entry may go directly beneath this one,
with an <email> tag if desired:

    <credit type="author">
      <name>Mate Documentation Team</name>
    </credit>

Directory Structure
-------------------

Please respect the directory structure:
  mate-user-guide/<docname>/C/<docname>.page(stub,tmpl)
  mate-user-guide/<docname>/C/figures/
  mate-user-guide/<docname>/C/template/

In some cases, it may make sense to nest things one level deeper.  However,
do not nest things less deep.

The entire MATE Development Team appreciates your help and interest.
