Directory Structure
-------------------

Please respect the directory structure:
  mate-user-guide/<docname>/C/<docname>.page(stub,tmpl)
  mate-user-guide/<docname>/C/figures/
  mate-user-guide/<docname>/C/template/

In some cases, it may make sense to nest things one level deeper.  However,
do not nest things less deep.
