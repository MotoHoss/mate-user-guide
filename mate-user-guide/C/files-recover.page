  <title>Recover a file that you deleted</title>
    <p>
      If you deleted a file in the <gui>File Manager</gui> by pressing <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>Delete</key></keyseq> or clicking the <gui>Move to Trash</gui> option in the right-click menu, the file should be in the Trash. To access the Trash:
    </p>
    <steps>
      <item>
	<p>Open the <app>Files</app> application from the
	<gui>Activities</gui> overview.</p>
      </item>
      <item><p>
        In the <gui>Places</gui> menu in the sidebar, click <gui>Trash</gui>.
      </p></item>
      <item><p>
        If your deleted file is there, right-click on it and select <gui>Restore</gui>.  It will be restored to the folder it was deleted from.
      </p></item>
    </steps>

<p>If you deleted the file using <keyseq><key>Shift</key><key>delete</key></keyseq>, or from the command line, the file can't be recovered using this method because it has been permanently deleted.</p>

<p>There are a number of recovery tools available that are sometimes able to recover files that were permanently deleted. They are generally not very easy to use, however. If you accidentally permanently deleted a file, it's probably best to ask for advice on a support forum to see if you can recover it.</p>
