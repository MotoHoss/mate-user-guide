  <title>Notifications and the Messaging Tray</title>

  <section id="what">
  <title>What's a notification?</title>

  <p>If an application or a system component wants to get your attention, a
  notification will be shown at the right of the top panel.</p>

  <p>For example, if you get a new chat message, new updates are available for
  your computer, or your computerâ€™s battery is low, you will get a notification
  informing you about that.</p>

  <p>The notification will first appear as a single line, so as to be least
  distracting. You can move your mouse over it if you want to see its full
  content.</p>

<title>The Messaging Tray</title>
  <p>The Messaging Tray gives you a way to get back to your notifications when
  it is convenient for you. It appears when you move your mouse to the bottom
  right corner of the screen and contains all the notifications that you have
  not acted upon or that permanently reside in it.</p>

  <p>You can view the notifications by clicking on the Messaging Tray items.
  The items in the Messaging Tray are usually applications that sent you
  notifications.</p>

  <p>The Messaging Tray is always visible in the Top panel.</p>
