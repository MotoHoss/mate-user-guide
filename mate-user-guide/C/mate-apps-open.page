<p>Move your mouse pointer to the <gui>Activities</gui> corner at the top left of the screen to show the <gui>Activities Overview</gui>. This is where you can find all of your applications. (You can open the overview by pressing the <link xref="windows-key">windows key</link> too.)</p>

<p>There are several ways of opening an application once you're in the activities overview:</p>

<list>
 
 <item>
  <p>Start typing the name of an application - it should search for it instantly. (If this doesn't happen, click the search bar at the top right of the screen and then start typing.) Then, click the application's icon to start it.</p>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>Click the <gui>Applications</gui> heading at the top of the screen to see a list of applications you can run. You can filter them by type using the categories on the right, or search using the search bar at the top right. Click the application's icon to start it.</p>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>Some applications have icons in the <em>dash</em> (the vertical strip of icons on the left-hand side of the activities overview). Click one of those to start that application.</p>
  <p>If you have applications that you use very frequently, you can <link xref="shell-apps-favorites">add them to the dash</link> yourself.</p>
 </item>
 
 <item>
  <p>You can launch an application in a separate workspace by dragging an application's icon from the dash (or from the list of applications), and dropping it on one of the workspaces on the right-hand side of the screen. The application will open in the workspace that you choose.</p>
 </item>
 
</list>

<note style="tip">
 <title>Quickly running a command</title>
 <p>Another, more advanced way of running an application is to use its <em>command name</em>, which you can do by pressing <keyseq><key>Alt</key><key>F2</key></keyseq>, entering a command, and then pressing <key>Enter</key>.</p>
 <p>For example, to launch <app>Rhythmbox</app>, press <keyseq><key>Alt</key><key>F2</key></keyseq> and type 'rhythmbox' (without the single-quotes). The name of the app is the command to launch the program.
