<title>Change your password</title>
<p>It is a good idea to change your password from time to time, especially if you think someone else knows what your password is.</p>
   <steps>
    <item><p>Click your name on the top bar and select <gui>My Account</gui>.</p></item>
    <item><p>Click the button label next to <gui>Password</gui>. It should look
    like a series of dots or boxes if you already have a password set.</p></item>
      <item><p>
        Fill in your <gui>Current password</gui>, a <gui>New password</gui>, and <gui>Confirmation password</gui> (which needs to be exactly the same as the <gui>New password</gui>).
   </p></item>
         <item><p>
      Click <gui>Change</gui>.
   </p></item>
   </steps>

<p>Make sure you <link xref="user-goodpassword">choose a good password</link>. This will help to keep your user account safe.</p>

    <title>Change the keyring password</title>

  <p>If you change your login password, it may become out of sync with the <em>keyring password</em>.
  The keyring keeps you from having to remember lots of different passwords by just requiring one
  <em>master</em> password to access them all. If you change your user password (see above), your keyring password will remain the same as your old password and so the keyring won't be <em>unlocked</em> automatically when you log in.</p>
    
  <p>To change your keyring password (to match your login password):</p>
  <steps>
  <item><p>Open the <app>Passwords and Encryption Keys</app> application from
  the <gui>Activities</gui> overview.</p></item>
    <item><p>
    In the <gui>Passwords</gui> tab, right-click on <gui>Passwords: login</gui>.  Select <gui>Change Password</gui>.
  </p></item>
    <item><p>
    Enter your <gui>Old Password</gui>, followed by your new <gui>Password</gui>, and <gui>Confirm</gui> your new password by entering it again.
  </p></item>
    <item><p>
    Click <gui>OK</gui>.
  </p></item>
  </steps>
