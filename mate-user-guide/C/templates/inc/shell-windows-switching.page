    <title>From a workspace:</title>
<list>
<item><p>
Press <keyseq><key>Alt</key><key>Tab</key></keyseq> to switch between windows.
</p>

<note style="tip">
<p>
 The windows are grouped by application and the previews of the applications with multiple windows are available as you click through. The previews show up after a short delay, but you can get them immediately by clicking the ↓ arrow key. 
</p>
</note>


<note>
<p>
The applications running on other workspaces are displayed after a vertical separator. Including all applications in the <keyseq><key>Alt</key><key>Tab</key></keyseq> makes switching between tasks a single step process and provides you with a full picture of what applications are running. 
</p>
</note>

<item><p> 
You can move between the preview windows with the → or ← arrow keys or with the mouse pointer.
</p></item>

 Previews of applications with a single window are only available when the ↓ arrow is explicitly hit.

     It is possible to switch to any window by moving to it with the mouse and clicking.
