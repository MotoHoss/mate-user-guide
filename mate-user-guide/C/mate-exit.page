  <p> Initial Port more work is needed on this page - more links to other guide pages.</p>
  <p>Also since we do not ship our own "switch user display manager" the instructions may vary."</p>

<p>When you've finished using your computer, you can turn it off, suspend it
(to save power),or leave it powered on and just log out.</p>

<title>Log out or switch users</title>
 <p>To let other users use your computer, you can either log out, or
 leave yourself logged in and just switch users. If you just switch
 users, all of your applications will continue running, and everything
 will be where you left it when you log back in.</p>

 <p>To log out, shut down or reboot click the <em>System</em> Menu on
 the top panel and select the appropriate option.</p>

<title>Lock the screen</title>
  <p>If you're leaving your computer for a short time, you should lock
  your screen to prevent other people from accessing your files and
  running applications. When you return, simply enter your password to
  log back in. If you don't lock your screen, it will lock
  automatically after a certain amount of time.</p>

  <p>To lock your screen, click again in the <em>System</em> menu and
  choose <em>Lock Screen</em>.

  <gui>Lock Screen</gui>.</p>
  <p>When your screen is locked, other users can log in to their own
  accounts by clicking <gui>Switch User</gui> on the password screen.
  You can switch back to your desktop when they are finished.</p>

<title>Suspend, shut down, or restart.</title>

  <p>To save power, turn off your computer when you aren't using it. By
  default, <em style="strong">MATE</em> simply suspends your computer.
  This saves your state to your computer's memory and powers most of
  your computer's functions. A very small amount of power is still
  used during suspend.</p>

  <p>To suspend your computer, left click the <em>System</em> menu on
  the top panel and then select <gui>Shutdown</gui>. If you want to from
  that screen you can see that you can Suspend, Hibernate, Restart
  Cancel or Shutdown your computer. Your computer will automatically
  suspend when the lid is closed.</p>

  <p>If you want to power off your computer entirely, or do a full
  restart, simply use the same method and press the shutdown button in
  the new window. There is also a <gui>Suspend</gui> option or
  <gui>Hibernate</gui> option.</p>

  <note><p>If there are other users logged in, you may not be allowed to
  power off or restart the computer, because this will end their
  sessions. If you are an administrative user, you may be asked for the
  root password to power off.</p></note>
